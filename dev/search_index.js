It also contains a list of pre-defined parametrizations to test with.\n“Quaternionic Geometry Toolkit” - Formalization of the quaternionic description of immersed surfaces. Explicit generation of christoffel dual surfaces, spin transforms and numerical integration of a given differential form.\n“isothermic Cylinder Tools” - Implementation of the “Isothermic Tori” paper with numerical computation to generate the immersion of an isothermic cylinder given w tau omega\n“jacobi Theta Extension” - An extension of the jacobi theta functions used in the project extending the functionality slightly from the EllipticFunctions.jl package","category":"page"},{"location":"#Visualization-Baseline","page":"Home","title":"Visualization Baseline","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The framework constructed is aimed to visualize any parametric function","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"f U to mathbbR^3","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"where U = x_min x_max times y_min y_max subset mathbbR^3.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This base uses GLMakie for rendering and simply creates wrappers around the “surface!” and “wireframe!” functions to allow inputting literal maps f and x and y domain values generating U.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"There is also a simple construction of a GeometryBasics Mesh given the “createParametricMesh” function which allows for outputting the parametrization of our function into an “.obj” for futher visualization in programms like Blender (This functionality can be seen in the Interactive Scene “visualiseParametricSurfaces.jl”)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Eventhough the Project centers around generating parametric functions for very complicated constructions (namely the isothermic Torus and its Bonnet Surfaces) we have added some simple pre-built parametric functions that can all be seen in action in the “visualiseParametricSurfaces.jl” scene.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"One note is that the parametrization given for the Wente Torus, a closely related surface to the topic of isothermic Tori and Bonnet Pairs is taken from Rolf Walter’s “Explicit Examples to the H-Problem of Heinz Hopf”.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A very similar wrapper structure is only lightly implemented for curves in “ParametricCurveTools.jl”.
