This Project aims to visualise constructions given in a paper by Alexander Bobenko, Tim Hoffmann and Andrew O. Sageman-Furnas called [“Compact Bonnet Pairs: isometric tori with the same curvatures”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06335). It was created under the supervision of Prof. Tim Hoffmann at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology.
